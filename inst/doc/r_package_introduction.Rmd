# The R Package

The package `dmdScheme` is a base package for the usage and development of domain specific metadata schemes. It provides functionality to enter the metadata, validate the entered metadata, and export it to xml format for further processing by e.g. archival repositories. This document will give an overview over the `dmdScheme` package and what it contains. More detailed information about the development, including a suggested workflow to create a new scheme definition, can be found in the vignette **Howto create a new scheme**.

## Installation

The recommended way is to install from CRAN the stable released version:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dmdScheme")
```


To install the **master** branch, the stable branch which will become the new CRAN release, from the [dmdScheme repository on github](https://github.com/Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/dmdSchemeRepository/tree/master), run
 
```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## install the devtools package if not installed yet
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/dmdScheme", ref = "master", build_opts = NULL)
```
 
If you are feelinfg adventourous, want to live at the bleeding edge and can live with non-working features, you can install the **dev** branch. This branch is **not stable** and features and functionality can appear or be remioved without prior notice:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## install the devtools package if not installed yet
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/dmdScheme", ref = "dev", build_opts = NULL)
```
 
Other branches are not generally recommended for instalation unless you are developing `dmdScheme`!

## Loading the package

When you load the package, the definition of the scheme is downloaded from the [dmdScheme repository](https://github.com/Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/dmdSchemeRepository/tree/master) installed to a temporary scheme library in a temporary directory for usage in this R session. As this scheme library is styored in a temporary directory, it will be deleted when youu quit your R session and re-downloaded each time you start a new session and load the package. To create a permanent package library you have to create a cache in the user directory. To do this, run

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
cache(createPermanent = TRUE)
```

and restart your R session. Noiw the definitions of the installed `dmdSchemes` will be installed in this user cache and be available permanently. For further info, see the documenatation of the command `cache()`.


## Managing installed schemes
 
Once loaded, the default scheme definition from the package is, when necessary, installed and used.

There are several commands to manage installed schemes. All these commands start with `scheme_`.

These are in detail:

### `scheme_default()`
returns the default scheme and version, i.e. the one with which the dmdScheme package is based. This can be the `dmdScheme` package itself, or a package crewated with `make_new_package()`.

```{r}
scheme_default()
```

### `scheme_list_in_repo()`
Show the schemes available in a repo. The defaut repo is [](https://github.com/Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/dmdSchemeRepository). The function reads and simly returns the file `SCHEME_DEFINITIONS.yaml` in the folder `schemes` in the repository.


```{r}
scheme_list_in_repo()
```

### `scheme_install()`
Install a new scheme definition. In the normal usecase, this function uses `scheme_download_url()` to download the scheme defintion from the default [github repository](https://github.com/Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/dmdSchemeRepository) and installs it. The usage is

```{r}
scheme_install(name = "emeScheme", version = "0.9.5")
```


### `scheme_list()`
Shows the installed schemes.
```{r}
scheme_list()
```

### `scheme_use()`
Activate the scheme `NAME` with version `VERSION`

```{r}
scheme_use(name = "emeScheme", version = "0.9.5")
```

### `scheme_active()` 
Shows the currently active scheme.

```{r}
scheme_active()
scheme_use(name = "dmdScheme", version = "0.9.5")
scheme_active()
```


### `scheme_uninstall()`
Uninstall an installed scheme. The scheme definition, is deleted from the scheme library, and moved to a temporary flder which wil be deleted at the end of the R session.
```{r}
scheme_uninstall(name = "emeScheme", version = "0.9.5")

```

### `scheme_installed()
Return `TRUE, if the scheme is installed
```{r}
scheme_installed(name = "emeScheme", version = "0.9.5")
```


### `scheme_path_xlsx()`
Returns the path to the `.xlsx` representation of the currently active scheme.
```{r}
scheme_path_xlsx()
```

### `scheme_path_xml()`
Returns the path to the `.xml` representation of the currently active scheme.
```{r}
scheme_path_xml()
```

### `scheme_make()`
This function is used to package a new scheme. For details see the vignette `Howto Create a new scheme`.

# Entering new Metadata

To enter new data to the dmdScheme, you have to run the command

```{r eval = FALSE}
open_new_spreadsheet()
```

This will open Excel and the file should look similar to this, when looking at the second tab:

![](./figs/enter_new_data.png)

The following points are important to remember:

1) The file is saved in a **temporary** directory. It needs to be saved at a different location, if you want to keep the changes.
2) Data can only be entered in the green cells with. All other cells are write protected.

After entering the data, save it to a location for further processing.


## Importing Data from Excel Sheet

Next, you have to import the data entered in the Excel sheet into R. For simplicity, we use here a file included in the package. If you want to load your own file, replace `scheme_path_xlsx()` with the file name and path to that file.

```{r}
x <- read_excel(
      file = scheme_path_xlsx(),
      verbose = TRUE
)
```

The `verbose = TRUE` argument will produce messages which will show you what is happening and will help to identify problems.

## Print dmdScheme Data

`dmdScheme` Data can be printed by using the `print()` function. The function has three arguments which control the printout:

* `printAttr`: if `TRUE` (default) print the **basic** attributes prefixed with `A   `
* `printExAttr`: if `TRUE` print the **all** attributes prefixed with `X   `
* `printData`: if `TRUE` (default) print the data prefixed with `D   `

```{r}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = FALSE,
  printExtAttr = FALSE,
  printData = FALSE
)
```

```{r}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = TRUE,
  printExtAttr = FALSE,
  printData = FALSE
)
```

```{r}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = TRUE,
  printExtAttr = TRUE,
  printData = FALSE
)
```

```{r}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = TRUE,
  printExtAttr = TRUE,
  printData = TRUE
)
```

## Validating your metadata

The metadata in the spreadsheet can be validated by using the following command and which results in an object of class `dmdScheme_validation`.

```{r}
validate( scheme_path_xlsx() )

```


To create a report (html, pdf or docx) yo can use the `report()` function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
report( scheme_path_xlsx() )
```

which will open a html report in your browser.

## Converting Metadata to xml

You can export the data to an an `xml_document` object as defined in the `xml2` package to do further processing:

```{r}
x <- read_excel( scheme_path_xlsx() )
xml <- as_xml( x, file = xmlFile)
xml
```

You can save the xml to a file by using

```{r}
xmlFile <-  tempfile(fileext = ".xml")

xml2::write_xml(x = xml, file = xmlFile)
```

or directly in one command
```{r}
xmlFile <-  tempfile(fileext = ".xml")

write_xml( x = x, file = xmlFile )
```

## Re-import from xml into R

```{r}
x <- read_xml( xmlFile )
x
```



## General things

The `dmdScheme` data in R can be also saved, loaded, and edited using the standard R commands.
